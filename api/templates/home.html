      <h2 class="leader__heading">Welcome to Family Foodie</h2>
      <h3 class="leader__copy">Take the hard work out of meal planning</h3>
      <div class="primary__copy">
      <ul>
        <li>Do you love to cook but hate to plan?</li>
        <li>Do you spend too much time writing shopping lists?</li>
        <li>Are you sick of going to the supermarket everyday or scavanging through your pantry?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It's time to take the hard work out of meal planning and automate those shopping lists. It's time to become a Family Foodie!</p>
      <p>Family Foodie is so simple you can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create your meal plan and shopping list for the week in minutes while waiting for a bus</li>
        <li>Know the competative prices for ingredients before going shopping</li>
        <li>Keep a copy of all your favourite recipes online - easy to search and accessible from anywhere</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>A meal plan at the press of a button</h3>
      <p>They say you eat with your eyes first. That's why our meal planner is a visual delight and oh so simple! You can search recipes based on as little as one ingredient or leave your fate in the hands of our meal plan automation. Our automation is designed to be...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Balanced: automatically selects meals which are all distinct from one another (eg. chicken in risotto, veggie with burger bun, pork with veg)</li>
        <li>Seasonally adjustable: surface tacos, salads and pizza meals more often in summer and soups / pasta meals more often in winter</li>
        <li>Variety: it will avoid choosing meals you've had recently. No more eating the same meals every week!</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Ordered shopping lists on the fly</h3>
      <p>Let's be honest: writing shopping lists is a bore.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Automatically create seperate lists for shopping and what's in the pantry</li>
        <li>Simply drag and drop between shopping/pantry lists when things run out</li>
        <li>Shopping lists ordered for easy supermarket navigation</li>
        <li>Know how much you should expect to pay and shop with confidence</li>
        <li>Tick ingredients off as you buy them</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Only the food you love</h3>
      <p>You have full control over recipes in your account:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Don't like one of our default recipes? Delete it!</li>
        <li>Upload your own recipes in PDF form and do away with those physical copies for good.</li>
	<li>Only you have access to your recipes, so you can keep Grandma's secrect sauce a secret!</li>
        <li>No more flipping through recipe books filled with bookmarks, all your recipes are at your fingertips with our powerful recipe search.</li>
      </ul>
